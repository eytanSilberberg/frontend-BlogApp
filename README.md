# CHANGES MADE TO frontend repository

- <h4> Added 404 page</h4>
  If by any chance the user gets an error, we want to be able to show the user a nicely genorated page that tells him about the error

- <h4>Added imports and export statements</h4>
  As we know import and exports can make the code look clearer and more readble. By doing these actions we basically show only the important pieces of the code that relevant in order to understand it better.
