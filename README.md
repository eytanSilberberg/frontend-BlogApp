# Welcome to the Blog App!
Thank you for visiting the Blog App repository. This is a CRUD application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Live Site

You can also explore the deployed version of this application on Vercel. [Visit Frontend Live Site.](https://frontend-blog-6doo47hxk-eytansilberberg.vercel.app/)

The code was depolyed on vercel on the frontend and uses the python and mongodb repo

**Backend Setup (MongoDB)**
To run the backend server, please follow these steps:

* Clone the MongoDB backend repository from this link: [MongoDB Backend Repo](https://github.com/eytanSilberberg/backend-BlogApp.git)

* Navigate to the cloned repository folder.

* Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

* Create a virtual environment (venv) using the command python -m venv venv.

* Activate the virtual environment with source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows).

* Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Start the backend server by running python uvicorn main:app --reload

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate (Windows).
pip install -r requirements.txt.
uvicorn main:app --reload
```



Note: The venv folder is not included in the repository, so you need to create it locally.
